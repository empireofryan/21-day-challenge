    "notes": "Falling Rock Tap House permanently closed in June 2021 after 24 years at 1919 Blake St. Confirmed closed by Yelp (updated Aug 2025), Denver Post, 9News, CBS Colorado, and Denver7. The closure was attributed to COVID-19 impacts, a construction project that caused 30% sales drop, and neighborhood changes. Their website (fallingrocktaphouse.com) still returns a 503 error. This venue should be removed from the aggregator."

IMPORTANT DATA QUALITY NOTE: The happy hour data comes from Happy Hour Finder aggregator, which lists multiple overlapping time windows (11 AM-7 PM, 3-6 PM, 3-7 PM, 4-7 PM) that may reflect different periods or data updates rather than concurrent specials. Herb's official website (herbsbar.com) and their Downtown Denver Bars listing do NOT list specific happy hour details. Yelp lists hours as Mon-Sat 5 PM-2 AM, Sun 3 PM-2 AM, which conflicts with some of the earlier happy hour start times listed on aggregators. The aggregator data may be outdated. Best to call (303) 299-9555 or (303) 296-9733 to confirm current specials. Musician-owned venue known for live music. Best of Denver 2025 Winner. Never a cover charge."
